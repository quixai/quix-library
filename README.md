# Quix library
## Library samples repository for [Quix](https://quix.ai) platform. 

The Quix library contains pre-built, open source code samples that you can use to quickly create a pipeline that transforms data in real time while it travels from source to destination. 

## The library includes three types of samples: 

Sources: data connectors that you can plug and play. Or add an API gateway to push data. If you have a project in mind but the connector isn’t available, you can develop your own and share the code with Quix users by adding it to the library. You never know what kind of projects you might be supporting.

Transformations: code samples you can use as-is or modify to make your application more functional. Extract and load, merge, synchronize, enrich, predict or anything else you might want to do with your data — the options are endless since you can extend the samples with any class, method, package or library.

Destinations: the connectors to analytics dashboards, alerts, data warehouses and any other form of delivery. What’s the good of transforming data if you can’t easily apply it?

Explore, develop and deploy them directly on https://portal.platform.quix.ai.
