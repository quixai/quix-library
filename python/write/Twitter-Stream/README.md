# Twitter Stream Example

A Quix model can be used to bridge data from almost any source. In this case we'll be using a Twitter developer account to stream Tweet data with a view to running real time ML models on the feed later on.

## Requirements / Prerequisites

 - A Twitter developer account (sign up at [https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access))

## Environment Variables

The code sample uses the following environment variables:

- **output**: This is the output topic for Twitter data.
- **twitter_bearer_token**: Your Twitter bearer token.

## Docs
Check out the [SDK Docs](https://quix.ai/docs/sdk/introduction.html) for detailed usage guidance

## How to Run
Create an account on [Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.ai/self-sign-up?xlink=github) to Edit or Deploy this application without a local environment setup.

Alternatively, you can check [here](/python/local-development) how to setup your local environment.
